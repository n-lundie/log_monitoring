# Log Monitoring Tool 
A Rust command line application for generating reports based on process logs.

## Getting Started 
The easiest way to build and test the application is with Cargo. This guide assumes you have Cargo and rustc 1.84 or higher installed. If not, follow (this guide)[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install] and then come back here.
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/n-lundie/log_monitoring.git 
```
2. Navigate into the repository
3. Run unit tests 
```bash
cargo test 
```
4. Build the application
```bash
cargo build --release 
```
5. Copy the binary into the top level directory
```bash
cp target/release/log_monitoring log_monitoring
```
6. Run the application on the log file 
```bash
./log_monitoring ./logs.log
```
7. The report will be generated in the same directory that you run the command from. An example of this output can be in the `report.log` file in this repo
